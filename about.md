Hello, I'm Mike Harsch and this is my blog.  Topics here will include IoT
(Internet of Things), distributed computing, computer architecture, networking,
parallel computing, robotics, electronics, and computer science education.  I
hope you will find the content useful (at best) or at least amusing.
